# Video Similarity Challenge

## Goal of the Competition
Competitors built models to help detect whether a given query video is derived from any of the videos in a large reference set.

The ability to identify and track content on social media platforms, called content tracing, is crucial to the experience of users on these platforms. Previously, Meta AI and DrivenData hosted the [Image Similarity Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/80/competition-image-similarity-2-dev/page/378/) in which participants [developed](https://drivendata.co/blog/image-similarity-winners/) state-of-the-art models capable of accurately detecting when an image was derived from a known image. The motivation for detecting copies and manipulations with videos is similar â€” enforcing copyright protections, identifying misinformation, and removing violent or objectionable content. 

This competition allowed users to test their skills in building a key part of that content tracing system, and in so doing contribute to making social media more trustworthy and safe for the people who use it.

***

There were two tracks to this challenge:

* For the **[Descriptor Track](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/101/meta-video-similarity-descriptor/)**, the goal was to generate useful vector representations of videos for this video similarity task. Competitors generated descriptors for both query and reference set videos, and a standardized similarity search using pair-wise [inner-product similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product) was used to generate ranked video match predictions.
* For the **[Matching Track](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/106/meta-video-similarity-matching/)**, the goal was to create a model that directly detects clips of a query video that correspond to clips in one or more videos in a large corpus of reference videos.
